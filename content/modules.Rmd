# How to use this resource

You use this resource by running R code! This may sound intimidating if you've never used R before, so we've made a video that walks through what you need to do.

Get started by going to R Studio Cloud - https://rstudio.cloud - and creating an account. When you've signed up, start a new project, and copy-paste the code below to install packages. (If you already have R and R Studio working on your local computer then you don't have to use R Studio Cloud, you can install the packages on your local machine instead.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('remotes')
install.packages('opendatatoronto')
remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
```

Then you can install the `DoSStoolkit`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("RohanAlexander/DoSStoolkit")
```

You'll use the function `run_tutorial` to run each module. At the moment we have nine modules. So you can pick one to start with. For instance, if you wanted to run the 'hello world' module then run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("hello_world", package = "DoSStoolkit")
```

For reference, a complete collection is here:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("hello_world", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("holding_the_chaos_at_bay", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("operating_in_an_error_prone_world", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("hand_me_my_plyrs", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("totally_addicted_to_base", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("he_was_a_d8er_boi", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("to_ggplot_or_not_to_ggplot", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("r_marky_markdown", package = "DoSStoolkit")
learnr::run_tutorial("git_outta_here", package = "DoSStoolkit")
```
